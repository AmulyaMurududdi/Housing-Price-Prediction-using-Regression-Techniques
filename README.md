# Housing-Price-Prediction-using-Regression-Techniques
This project focuses on predicting housing prices using the California Housing Dataset from sklearn, applying various regression techniques and machine learning practices. Below is the approach followed for the execution of the  project.
# 1. Dataset and Data Preprocessing
- **Dataset**: California Housing Dataset from sklearn.
- Handle missing values, duplicate values, and outliers.
- Apply Min-Max scaling to normalize the data.
## 2. Data Exploration and Visualization
- Visualize the data to identify relationships between features and target variable (housing prices).
- Use scatter plots, heatmaps, and other visual tools to analyze correlations.
## 3. Feature Scaling/Normalization
- Apply Min-Max Scaling to normalize feature values, ensuring that all features are on the same scale for better model performance.
## 4. Data Splitting
- Split the data into **training**, **evaluation**, and **testing** sets.
- **Suggested ratio**: 70% training, 10% evaluation, 20% testing.
## 5. Regression Algorithms
- Implement and evaluate different regression models:
  - **Linear Regression**.
## 6. Cross-Validation
- Perform **K-fold cross-validation** to estimate the model performance across different data subsets.
## 7. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Use **Grid Search** to find the best hyperparameters and fine-tune the models.
## 8. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate models using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and other netrics, compare performance across different techniques.
## 10. Prediction
- Use the selected model to make predictions on the test data.
## 11. Analysis and Interpretation
- Analyze the model's predictions and interpret the results.
## 12. Handling Categorical Features
- Apply **one-hot encoding** to handle categorical features in the dataset.
## 13. Ensemble Techniques
- Explore advanced ensemble techniques like **Stacking** and **Blending** for improved prediction accuracy.
